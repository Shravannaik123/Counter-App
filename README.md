Simple Counter App (Vanilla JavaScript)
This is a fundamental, single-page web application designed to demonstrate core front-end concepts: state management, event handling, and DOM manipulation, without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

🚀 Features
Increment: Increases the count by 1.

Decrement: Decreases the count by 1. The count is enforced to never go below 0.

Reset: Sets the count back to 0.

Responsive Design: Uses Tailwind CSS utilities for a modern, mobile-friendly layout.

🛠️ Technology Stack
HTML: Semantic structure.

CSS: Custom styles and Tailwind CSS for utility and responsiveness.

JavaScript: Pure Vanilla JS for all state and behavior logic.

⚙️ How to Run
Save the three files (index.html, style.css, script.js) into the same directory.

Open index.html in your web browser.

Key Learning Focus
The project emphasizes separating the application's internal state (the count variable) from the UI (the displayed number and button states), especially the conditional logic used to disable the decrement button when the count reaches zero.
